# minecraft-profile
SuperSaix's 1.12.2 Minecraft "profile".

The goal of this project is to define a comprehensive "modpack" in code. You'll notice that this repository accurately maps to the contents of the "/.minecraft" directory, such that this "profile" can be dropped into "/.minecraft" as a plug-and-play Minecraft experience!
